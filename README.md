# 👋 Hi, I'm Valentin Sutter

🎓 Student Engineer | 🐍 Python Tinkerer | 🌐 Web & Systems Developer | 🛠️ Hardware Hacker | 🚀 Space Tech Enthusiast  

I build the systems that keep missions running — from the edge of the stratosphere to the comfort of my gravity-assisted workspace.

My journey started with **Python**, automating everything I could touch. Since then, I’ve expanded into **web development**, **low-level systems**, and **hardware hacking** — fusing bits and atoms into working prototypes.

One of my proudest moments? Developing a **stratospheric balloon** at 15, capturing real-time sensor data and video from near space. That project didn’t just launch a payload — it launched my obsession with **space systems**, **satellite comms**, and building tech that doesn’t break at 30,000 meters.

## 🛠️ What I’m Into

- **Python**, from scripting to automation to embedded systems  
- **Web dev**, full-stack workflows and fast backend builds  
- **Hardware projects**, from soldering to signal processing  
- **Space technology**, especially comms and data systems  
- **Systems programming**, fast, efficient, and close to the metal
