# 👋 Hi, I'm Valentin Sutter

🎓 Student | 🐍 Python Enthusiast | 💻 Web Developer | 🛠️ Tech Innovator | 🚀 Space Enthusiast  

I began my tech journey with **Python**, creating automations and diving into hardware projects. Over time, I've expanded into **web development**, all while maintaining my passion for building innovative systems.

One of my most exciting experiences was working on a **stratospheric balloon project**, where we captured sensor data and live video from the edge of space. This experience deepened my interest in **space technology**, **satellite systems**, and the potential of **high-altitude experiments** — areas that continue to shape my approach to both software and hardware projects today.

## 🛠️ What I’m Into

- **Python** (automation, scripting, data processing)
- **Web development** (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, backend technologies)
- **Hardware projects** and **hardware hacking**
- **Space tech** (satellites, high-altitude experiments, exploration technologies)
- **Systems programming** and **cutting-edge technologies**
