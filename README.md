# 👋 Hi, I'm Valentin Sutter

🎓 Student | 🐍 Python Enthusiast | 🧑‍💻 Web Developer | 🎈 Former Space Balloon Explorer

I started my coding journey with **Python**, building automations and exploring hardware projects. Recently, I've been diving into **web development**.

Previously, I worked on a **stratospheric balloon project**, where we sent sensor data and live video from the edge of space. This experience sparked my interest in **space tech** and **communications systems**, and it continues to shape the way I approach both software and hardware projects today.

## 🛠️ Interests

- **Python** (scripting, automation)
- **Web development** (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- **Hardware projects** and **hardware hacking**
- **Space tech** and **communications systems** (satellites, high-altitude experiments)
- **Systems programming** and **exploring new technologies**
